# Project Description: RFM Analysis

This project aims to conduct RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using customer data. RFM analysis is an effective method for understanding customer purchasing behavior and segmenting them.

- **Recency:** Identifying new and loyal customers based on when they last made a purchase.
- **Frequency:** Segmenting customers based on how many times they made purchases within a specific period.
- **Monetary:** Analyzing the total spending amount of customers to identify high-value customers.

SQL queries have been used to gather and analyze data for each criterion. The results obtained will be used to develop marketing strategies, enhance customer loyalty, and create targeted campaigns.
